# Nespresso Market Research Proposal (ST3188)

## Overview
This repository contains a market research proposal developed for the University of London module ST3188 - Statistical Methods for Market Research.  
The project uses Nespresso as a case company to design a research approach addressing customer preferences, satisfaction drivers, and sustainability perceptions in the premium coffee market.

The focus is on research design and statistical planning, rather than conducting real fieldwork or running live SPSS analysis.

## Business Context
Nespresso seeks to maintain its leadership in the premium coffee market by:
- Innovating coffee blends and brewing technologies  
- Enhancing customer satisfaction and experience  
- Strengthening consumer perception of sustainability initiatives  

This proposal outlines how structured market research can support these objectives.

## Research Aims
The study is structured around three key aims:
- Understand customer preferences for new coffee blends and brewing technologies  
- Identify key drivers of customer satisfaction across regions and demographics  
- Evaluate perceptions of Nespresso’s sustainability initiatives  

## Methodology
The proposed research design integrates:
- Exploratory, descriptive, and causal research approaches  
- Online surveys and focus group discussions  
- Primary and secondary data sources  

## Sampling Strategy
- Probability sampling (two-stage cluster sampling) for Nespresso customers  
- Non-probability sampling (convenience sampling) for non-customers  
- Proposed minimum sample size: 385 respondents (95% confidence level)

## Questionnaire Design
A structured questionnaire was designed to capture:
- Demographic and geographic information  
- Coffee consumption behavior and preferences  
- Customer satisfaction dimensions  
- Sustainability awareness and perceptions  

The questionnaire supports the proposed multivariate analyses.

## Proposed Statistical Techniques
No real data analysis was conducted. The following SPSS-based statistical methods were specified to address the research objectives:
- Cluster Analysis  
- Two-way ANOVA  
- Multiple Linear Regression  
- Factor Analysis  
- Independent and Paired T-tests  

Each method was selected based on its relevance to business decision-making.

## Expected Insights
- Identification of customer segments and seasonal coffee preferences  
- Understanding of factors influencing customer satisfaction  
- Structured insights into sustainability perceptions  
- Actionable recommendations for marketing and product strategy  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Market research design  
- Sampling methodology  
- Questionnaire development  
- Multivariate statistical planning  
- Business interpretation of statistical outputs  
- SPSS analytical frameworks
